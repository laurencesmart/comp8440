The course will be divided into three phases

<ul>
<li><b>2nd April - Information Evening</b>. On Thursday the 2nd of
April there will be an introductory evening for students. The course
material will be outlined, and students will be given some reading
material that should be studied before the main course begins. The
main presentation for the information evening will be recorded so that
students who are not in Canberra on that day can see the material.

<li><b>14th to 18th April - Main course</b>. The main course will be
from the Tuesday to the Saturday (inclusive) in the week after
Easter. The course will run from 9am to 6pm each day, with a 1 hour
break for lunch.

<li><b>Assessment period</b>. After the main course is over, the
students are expected to prepare reports for assessment, which will be
due by Friday the 22nd of May. Details on assessment options will be
made available on this website closer to the start of the course.
