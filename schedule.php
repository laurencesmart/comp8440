The course will be divided into three phases

<ul>
<li><b>7th April - Information Evening</b>. On Thursday the 7th
of April starting at 7pm there will be an introductory evening for
students. The course material will be outlined, and students will be
given some reading material that should be studied before the main
course begins. The main presentation for the information evening will
be recorded so that students who are not in Canberra on that day can
see the material.

<li><b>18th to 21th April - Main course</b>. The main course will be
from the Monday to the Thursday (inclusive), in the week before Easter. 
The course will run from 9am to 6pm each day (with breaks).

<li><b>23rd April - student presentations</b>. On Saturday the 23rd of April each student will give a short presentation on their project. 

<li><b>30th April, 7th May, 14th May</b>. Laboratory sessions will be
offered between 2pm and 5pm on the three Saturdays following the main
course. These sessions are intended for students completing the
assessment part of the course.

<li><b>Assessment period</b>. After the main course is over, the
students are expected to prepare materials for assessment, which will
be due by Monday the 23rd of May. Details on assessment options are
available on the <a href="assessment.php">assessment page</a>.
