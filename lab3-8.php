</h1>
</center>

The labs on Tuesday to Friday are for you to work on a project of your
choice. The aim is to work with the project sufficiently to be able to
give a short (10 minute) presentation on your work on Saturday.<p>

The main steps in this lab work are:

<ul>
<li>Choosing your project
<li>Researching the project
<li>Learning to build and install the project
<li>Learning how to interact with the project developers
<li>Finding some way that you can contribute
<li>Working on your contribution
<li>Communicating with other project developers
<li>Writing up your work for your short presentation
</ul>

The details will vary with each project. For some projects, it may
take you most of the week just to learn how to build it. For others,
you may be able to make a substantial contribution very quickly.<p>

You should read carefully through the information on selecting a
project on the <a href="labwork.php">labwork</a> page, and also read
through the information on the <a href="assessment.php">assessment</a>
page to make sure you are gathering all the information you need.<p>

<h2>Ask questions!</h2>

Please make sure you ask for help from Bob or Andrew when you get
stuck. You may also find that another student knows how to solve a
problem, or perhaps you can help another student who is stuck.

<h2>Take notes</h2>

In order to be able to write a good report, it is important that you
keep good logs on your interactions with your chosen project.<p>

For logging of interactions with the project that happen via web
pages, the 'scrapbook' extension to Firefox is strongly
recommended. You should get in the habit of using 'Capture Page' in
scrapbook to capture key web pages as you come across them.<p>

If your chosen project uses an instant messaging system for
communication (for example, an IRC channel), then make sure you enable
logging in the IM tool you use. For example, if you use the 'pidgin'
tool, then make sure that 'Enable Logging' is set in the Options menu,
and make sure you find out where the tool is storing logs of your
conversations.<p>

For command line interactions (for example building a project), you
should get used to using the 'script' command to capture terminal
output. See the script(1) manual page for details.

<h2>The presentation</h2>

During the Saturday lab you will be asked to make a short presentation
on your project to the other students. This forms part of your
assessment, so make sure you have something well prepared.<p>

The way this presentation will work is we will redirect your screen,
keyboard and mouse to the projectors in the lab. You will then control
the display via the terminal at the front of the class. You may choose
to present your project in any way you want to. Some suggestions
include a OpenOffice presentation, or a set of web pages, or a
live demonstration.

<h1>MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP</h1>

Make sure you do a backup at the end of each lab, or you may lose all
your work.
