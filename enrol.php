This course may be undertaken as either a Masters level (ANU
accredited) course, or as a non-accredited (no assessment) course. The
non-accredited option is lower cost, but results in no formal grade.
</p>

<h2>Enrolling at Masters level</h2>

<p>
To enrol in COMP8440 at a masters level there are four program
options: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/7705XMCOMP;overview.html">Masters of Computing (MComp)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/7704XMITS%20;overview.html">Masters of Information Technology (MIT)</a></li>
  <li>Masters of Graduate Studies</li>
  <li>Non-award enrolment</li>
</ul>

<p>
All four programs have the same course fees, and have the same
pre-requisite requirements.
</p>

<p>
