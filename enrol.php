This course may be undertaken as either a Masters level (ANU
accredited) course, or as a non-accredited (no assessment) course. The
non-accredited option is lower cost, but results in no formal grade.

<h2>Enrolling at Masters level</h2>

To enrol in COMP8440 at a masters level there are four program
options: 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/7705XMCOMP;overview.html">Masters of Computing (MComp)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/7704XMITS%20;overview.html">Masters of Information Technology (MIT)</a></li>
    <li>Masters of Graduate Studies</li>
    <li>Non-award enrolment</li>
  </ul>

All four programs have the same course fees, and have the same
pre-requisite requirements.<p>

Fee information is available on
the <a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP8440;fees.html">course
fees</a> page. Note that the fees are different for domestic and
international students.<p>

a permission code from the Department of Computer Science
office. Requests for a permission code should be emailed
to <a href="mailto:office@cs.anu.edu.au">office@cs.anu.edu.au</a>. You
