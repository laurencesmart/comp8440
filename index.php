<h2>General Information</h2>

<ul>

<li> The course's formal requisite is enrolment in the  <a
href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/masters">Master of Computing</a>. However,
one-off enrollments may be made by people with the required assumed
knowledge.  Also students taking other degrees, including 4th year
undergraduates, may seek to enrol through special permission (contact
the course coordinator). 

<p>
<li> Assumed knowledge is basic competence with using a Unix-like
operating system (such as Linux). Having some competence in at least
one programming language will be an advantage.
